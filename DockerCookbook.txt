To Build, create or re-create, start, and attach to containers for a service.
The big advantage of using Compose is you can define your application stack in a file, keep it at the root of your project repo
	docker-compose up -d 	
		-d : Detached mode: Run containers in the background
		This will look for a .yml file in the current directory	
	
To List Containers
	docker ps 		(shows just running containers)
	docker ps -all 	(shows all containers)
	
To return low-level information on Docker objects
	docker inspect {containerID}
	
To run a command in a docker container
	docker exec -i composedev-mysqld-1
		-i (interactive keep STDIN open even if not attached)
		composedev-mysqld-1 (found by running the docker ps and copying the name of the container)
